# **Intro**

### Intro is the first whitepaper that you would want to read. It contains every important information that is necessary to see the _**big picture**_ of our efforts. It contains the whys to everything in regards to this organization's future vision and strategy, well, almost everything. 

### A whitepaper is any written piece of text that informs some audience about a solution to a problem. Whitepapers are used widely in organizations to explain the organization's solution to a problem or to _**paint**_ the organization's view on a complex issue. _**In the same vein**_, we are going to _**put up**_ these whitepapers here in this `whitepapers` repo to _**shed some light**_ on the thought process behind the organization's important decisions and strategies. 

### Now _**without further ado**_, let's get this started. The experiments repositories were created not for training purposes. They were originally intended to be a reference repository that helps you quickly remember the solution to a specific well-defined problem. And I believe that the experiments repositories still fulfill that purpose. 

### The overall attitude of the pilots had changed significantly since we started, the experiments in the pilots are now more _**hands-on**_ than ever before. Because of this change, we created playground repositories that allows us to play around with the concepts in experiments repositories in a separate individual playground repository. For example, when learning the experiments in `pro-experiments`, the players now use the individual playground repository `adventurist` to document and execute all the experiments in `pro-experiments`. The below table shows the experiments-repositories and the playground-repositories associated with them: 


experiments-repository | player's playground-repository 
:----: | :----: 
`pro-experiments` | `adventurist`  
`art-experiments` | `survivalist`
`fluxion-experiments` | `fluxionist` 
`why-experiments` | `pragmatist`
